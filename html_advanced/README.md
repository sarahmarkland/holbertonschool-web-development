# HTML Advanced Project

## General

This Web Development project is an assignment from the Holberton School Tulsa, Trimester 3, Full Stack program. The aim of this project is to convert a simple, visual template of a website from wireframe to HTML using Figma. This project will be completed using only HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
### What is HTML

    HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language, is a standard markup language used for creating and structuring web pages and web applications. It forms the backbone of most web content and provides the structure and organization of the various elements on a web page, including text, images, links, forms, and multimedia.

    HTML uses a system of tags (enclosed within angle brackets, like <tag>) to define and label different types of content on a web page. These tags are used to describe the structure of the page and how its elements should be displayed in a web browser. For example:

    <html>: This tag encloses the entire HTML document.
    <head>: Inside the head section, you define meta-information about the page, such as its title, character encoding, and linked stylesheets.
    <title>: Sets the title of the web page, which appears in the browser's title bar or tab.
    <body>: Contains the main content of the web page, including text, images, links, and other elements.
